# java-the-amount-and-type-of-change-to-return-to-a-customer-


Java console application that determines the amount and type of change to return to a customer for a given sale.  Use a validation loop to prompt and get from the user the sale amount in the range $1-8.  Then use a validation loop to prompt and get from the user the amount tendered by the customer to insure it is at least the sale amount.  Calculate the number of fives, ones, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that should be returned to the customer.
